# learnpy

These are my (some-what) random Python learnings. <br>
They include mainly guided projects from various educational books, such as, [*Learn Python the Hard Way*](https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/) by Zed Shaw, and several books from [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/).<br><br>
The purpose of these assignments is to help me learn Python in a fun and goal-oriented way.<br>
Most of the files in the `learnpy` main folder are from [*Learn Python the Hard Way*](https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/) and was the first Python book I picked up to grasp the basic syntax and concepts in Python. <br><br>
Some examples of the exercises in this book include (but is not limited to):<br>
- data types
- for and while loops
- dicts
- inheritance
- creating text-based adventure games
<br>

My learnings from these exercises helped me move forward with my other programming learnings with more confidence since I was able to learn many of the programming basics through learning Python.
