# learnpy

These are my (some-what) random Python learnings. <br>
These mainly include guided projects from various educational books, such as, [*Learn Python 3 the Hard Way*](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/) by Zed Shaw, and several books from [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/).<br><br>
The purpose of these assignments is to help me learn Python in a fun and goal-oriented way.<br>
Most of the files in the `learnpy` main folder are from [*Learn Python 3 the Hard Way*](https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/) and was the first Python book I picked up to grasp the basic syntax and concepts in Python. <br><br>
Some examples of the exercises in this book include (but are not limited to):<br>
- data types
- inheritance and composition
- creating text-based adventure games
- testing with `PyTest`
- setting up a virtual environment
- an intro to building a webpage via `flask`

<br>
In this main folder, you will also find subfolders that include other books and/or projects I have completed.
<br>
<br>
My learnings from these exercises have helped me move forward with my other programming learnings with more confidence since I was able to learn many of the programming basics through Python.
