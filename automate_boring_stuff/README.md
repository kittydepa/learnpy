# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
These are my Python learning from the many exercises and guided projects found in the book:
[*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2) by Al Sweigart. As the title suggests, this book focuses on using several Python modules to be able to automate a variety of normally tediuous, error-prone, and time consuming tasks.<br>

Some of the tasks covered in this book included:
- reading JSON files in Python/ using a weather API to return current weather data from a location based on user input
- using `PyAutoGUI` to control the mouse and keyboard, and write a script to automatically fill out an online form
- open other programs automatically at a specified time
- and so much more!

<br>
This has by far been my favorite set of projects I have done within Python. It is beginner-friendly and helped me apply and firmly understand the basic concepts of Python and OOP in general.<br>
Learning how to automate tasks with Python has opened my curiousities and ambitions more by wanting to automate all the things, for general efficiency. <br><br>

I look forward to applying these learnings in my everyday and professional life to save both time and energy towards the less tedious tasks that may arise.
