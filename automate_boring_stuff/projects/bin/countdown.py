Guided project: Simple countdown program.
Ch 15 in 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' No Starch Press

Writing a simple countdown program that will play an alarm sound at the end of the countdown


At a high level, the program will:
    - Count down from 60
    - Play the sound file (alarm.wav) when the countdown reaches 0

The code will then need to:
    - Pause for 1 second in between displaying each number in the coundown, by calling time.sleep()
    - Call subprocess.Popen() to open the sound file with the default application
