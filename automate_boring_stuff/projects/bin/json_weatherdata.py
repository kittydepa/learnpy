Project @ end of Ch. 14 of Automate the Boring Stuff
Fetching the current weather data with weather API/ JSON data

This program will do the following:
- Read the requested location from the command line
- Download JSON weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org
- Convert the string of JSON data to a Python data structure
- Print the weather for today and the next two days

There, the code will need to do the following:
- Join strings in sys.argv to get the location
- Call requests.get() to download the weather
- Call json.loads() to convert the JSON data to a Python data structure
- Print the weather forecast
