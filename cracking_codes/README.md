# Cracking Codes with Python
This is yet another fantastic beginner book by Al Sweigart, titled [*Cracking Codes with Python*](https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/).<br>
This book focues on basic cryptology and its methods using Python.<br> <br>
I have started looking at this book and completing some of its exercises just for fun :)
