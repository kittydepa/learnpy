### Part 1. Loops that print even numbers from 1-10

## a. For loop

# for i in range(1, 1):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)
#     continue


## b. While loop

# i = 0

# while i  < 10:
#     i += 2
#     print(i)



# c. Recursive loop



## Part 2. Loops that print numbers divisible by 3, from 1-30
