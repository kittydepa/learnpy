Notes for the task:
    - use module 'argparse' (https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)

Basically the program needs to use the argparse module to create a command line tool where:
    - it can convert between UUIDs and "device identifiers" (in either order)
    - print the result to the terminal for the user to copy/use
    - have separate flags or subcommands for the 2 required functions
    - include help text that briefly describes how to use the tool
