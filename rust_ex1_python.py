# Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the mean (the average value), 
# median (when sorted, the value in the middle position), and mode 
# (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.


# # Step 1. make a random list of numbers to work with
# import random 

# list = []
# for i in range(0, 5):
#     n = random.randint(1, 10)
#     list.append(n)
# print(list) # Manually enter the output of this into list, so we are working with the same set of no.

list = [9, 7, 7, 9, 4]
